    <li>The word “Islam” means “submission to the will of God.”</li>
    <li>Followers of Islam are called Muslims.</li>
    <li>Muslims are monotheistic and worship one, all-knowing God,
      who in Arabic is known as Allah.</li>
    <li>Followers of Islam aim to live a life of complete submission to Allah.
      They believe that nothing can happen without Allah’s permission,
      but humans have free will.</li>
    <li>Islam teaches that Allah’s word was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him
      through the angel Gabriel.</li>
    <li>Muslims believe several prophets were sent to teach Allah’s law.
      They respect some of the same prophets as Jews and Christians,
      including Abraham, Moses, Noah and Jesus.
      Muslims contend that Muhammad was the final prophet.</li>
    <li>A central idea in Islam is “jihad,” which means “struggle.”
